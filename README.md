# 🔗 SatoLink

**SatoLink** is a simple, open-source tool that lets anyone create a short, shareable link to receive cryptocurrency payments — fast, easy, and usable anywhere.

## 🌍 Why SatoLink?
In a world where long crypto addresses are hard to share, SatoLink gives users a clean, simple username (like `/nurain`) they can share in bios, on business cards, or in DMs — perfect for creators, merchants, or everyday users.

## 🚀 Features
- Custom shortlink (e.g. `/yourname`)
- Displays BCH address with a scannable QR code
- Copy button for easy wallet tips
- Built-in QR code generation
- Mobile-friendly UI
- Ready to deploy
